# ngMasters
Angular dice interaction app loosely based on dice masters

plan is to have a player with some health who can take some damage and own some dice!

## toDo!
* Include some more detailed testing and get the repo to a standard which will allow others to understand the direction its taking
* Improve the way dice can be obtained
  * use some sort of look up table to do the chances of getting each dice
* Improve on management of player owned dice
  * Allow a player to favourite dice
  * Allow a player to create pre picked "decks" of dice
* Start working towards dice re-cycling / collection (following the basic rules from dice masters for)
  * this will include resource generation from a pool of pre-selected "pawn" dice
  * this will require resource management to "purchase" dice from the players "deck"

* ~~Set up the Dice-List component to switch selected dice when only 1 can be selected~~
